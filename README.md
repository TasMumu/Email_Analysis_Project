Effective communication is crucial in both professional endeavors and daily interactions. Clear communication not only resolves misunderstandings but also fosters productivity and collaboration.

Objective : 
Analyze internal email data to map communication patterns, identify key influencers, and optimize organizational efficiency through enhanced insights into collaboration dynamics.

Assumptions:
As a Data Analyst at Onyxdata Solutions, I analyze internal email data to gauge employee sentiments and optimize organizational efficiency.

Limitations:
The data provided only has details when (date) , who sent the email and their department details with their reaction (Positive , negative , neutral ) and status of the mail (Opened ,Unopened) and finally the topic we don't have any more context to anlayze the sentiment .
